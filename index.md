# About Me
Rf Embedded Software Engineer, looking to broaden my set of skills and 
hands on experience.

I am a passionate self-taught developer (course from Harvard university) who
is always eager to learn new skills. I bring a can-do attitude and extensive 
professional experience (career change from HR to Software).

Currently studying web development (along side my current role) from a 
self-paced course (CS50) run by Harvard University which already provided me 
with a comprehensive introduction to computer science:

This course that taught me the basics before my internship and current role
started with the fundamentals (C, Algorithmic Complexity, Data
Structures, manual memory management) and move to to higher level languages 
and concepts(Python, SQL and Web Design).

# My Projects

application to retrieve current temperature based on location.
- [RaspberryPi Project](https://github.com/raspberrypi/utils/tree/master/vclog): Internship project of moving closed source debugging code to open source.
