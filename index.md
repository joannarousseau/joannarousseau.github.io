# About Me
I am a passionate self-taught developer looking for a career change from HR to
Software Development. Always eager to acquire new skills, I bring a can-do
attitude and extensive professional experience.

Recently graduated from a self-paced course (CS50) run by Harvard University
which provided me with a comprehensive introduction to computer science. This
course started with the fundamentals (C, Algorithmic Complexity, Data
Structures, manual memory management) to higher level languages and concepts
(Python, SQL and Web Design).

# My Projects
- [Weather](https://github.com/joannarousseau/weather.git) â€” Command-line application to retrieve current temperature based on location.
